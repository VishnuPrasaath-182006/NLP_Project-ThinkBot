#🧠🤖 ThinkBot - "Built to think with you."

ThinkBot is an intelligent NLP-powered chatbot application designed to understand user queries and deliver meaningful, context-aware responses in real time. Built using Python and Streamlit, ThinkBot simulates human-like conversations by applying core Natural Language Processing techniques and machine learning models.

The app preprocesses user input through tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and vectorization, enabling it to accurately interpret intent and generate relevant responses. With a clean chat-style interface and session-based conversation history, ThinkBot offers a smooth and interactive user experience similar to modern AI assistants.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of NLP pipelines, text similarity models, and interactive AI deployment, making it ideal for real-world chatbot use cases such as customer support, education assistance, and personal AI companions.
